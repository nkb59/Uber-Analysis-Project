# Uber-Analysis-Project
Data Analysis in R (Side Project)

Hi there,

This is a beginner project using R in which I'm trying to analyze Uber's metadata which they publicly made available to everyone in 2014 regarding pick up locations, timings, etc...

This was an interesting project to take part in because it just went to show how much you can do with a certain amount of data and the ways you can present it and make it more presentable to the end user.

Thanks!

Sincerely,
Niketan Baranwal
